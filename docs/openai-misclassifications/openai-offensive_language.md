Hey dude !
Who the hell you think you are ?
Just because i DIDN'T use ALL THE TIME when i contribute to several articles even creating new ones, my log in to prove that I'M CREATING here, this gives you right to erase ALL my additions ? Those were just FEW additions from ALL my WORK ! That is NOT my work ! Is ...0.5 % from what i do here !
Who you think you are ?
Admin ? Editor ?
IF I will do the same on ALL your contributions, let's see if you like it a ?
FIRST, ASK, second, DOCUMENT yourself, third -YOU ARE NOT ""GOD"" to do what you want based on ....""your intuitions"" . You saw ...7-8 added links from ALL my work and you act like crazy ? This is SPAM ? Beside i DON'T HAVE ANY intention to promote ANY site, i even remove when i see broken links, etc !

So, STOP Judging and act stupidly !
You want to chace SPAM, LOOK HERE - these are websites with thousands of links in wikipedia and no one does anything from different STUPID reasons like - is a ""notable source"" - so WHAT ? this is giving rights to pages like ""livescience"" or ""europeana.eu https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile;=all&search;=Europeana.eu&fulltext;=Search

So, CHECK FIRST, act AFTER you have proves !"

Text: Damn wiki admins 

What is it with all these wiki admins and THEM not being able to follow RULES and policies such as the NPOV, 3RR and rules pertaining for VANDALISM.

if anyone knows how i can get in touch directly with SENIOR Admins i would greatly appreciate it as some admins just make their owns rules up on the spot while disobeying wikipedias rules and effectivly slamming banhammers

and no, im not talking about all admins, but i am talking about quite a few admins!

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical ""rule nazi"" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly ""this user is an asshole"" and explain why and state ""this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say ""asshole"" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a ""dick"" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to ""wait until after TFA"" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize ""hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's ""Will to Power"" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like ""nineteenth"" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for ""brevity's sake"" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to ""kick rocks.""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good. If Hell is other people, Wikipedia constantly proves itself to be the eighth and ninth circle.   "

Text: Wow 

Way to assume, my man.  I'm not saying that all of the stories about King Arthur were true, but Excalibur was a very real sword, and I do have it in my possession.  This is an irrefutable fact.  I have been interviewed by many historians and the like, and you're the first one that seems to think you know more than all of them.

Can you prove that I'm wrong?  Not only that my sword isn't the real thing, but that my claiming it is is such a travesty, that you cannot allow anyone else to see it at all?  I wonder what would happen, if the other Wikipedophiles got their poor little minds corrupted by a comment on a talk page, eh?

Referring to [].  Next time, do some research.  I won't bring it up again, but it's insulting to have someone like you treat me like a liar.

Text: "
 never 

I deleted all you message without reading. you are a sick and a cruel person. I would not like to see you ever again at my talk page.  
 Don't worry if you don't want to, you won't see me. Now, what you will keep seen is the problems that you do have. You got into them and are still in them since months ago. Am I not right? And there is a subtle mistake that you are making when addressing them. Curious about what it is? I will be here. Sick and cruel maybe but that is only a manifestation of being plain and true, no fictitious colors, no hidden things. Good luck with your holy war.   
OMG, how didn't I guess before. I know who you are. You left as  Dr. Jekyll, and you came back few days later as Mr. Hyde. You're really, really sick. You need to get some help. I feel sorry for you.  
 Is it really me who is sick? Maybe. Sort of a different illness as your, fortunately. Anyway, you don't want to look to what I am saying, no point to so much chitchatting. If you can really name my illnesses do so. It is useful and I don't mind.   
If you'd like to get a response at the message you left at Alison talk page, please remove it from there and re-post to you own talk page. As you rightly said Alison has nothing to do with the message that was addressed to me, and her talk page should be left alone.  
I asked you to delete it from Alison's talk page, you only copied it. Please delete it, it does not belong there, and we'll talk,  
 Well, it does belong there. It is not only a message to you, it is also a message to the other two that were there. Why would I post it there if not because it completes a story only said in half? I said to continue here because the rest seems to be going to be about me. But notice the text there hints the readers here so that if they want to read more they know here to come. If I delete that paragraph there, not only info is lost there, but also nothing links to the continuation here.

(copied from another place)

Sole purpose? Just look my at my user contributions. Sorry, but you are prizing yourself too much thinking that the my sole purpose is to ""help you"". It is the other way around. Just by chance, I noticed that your problems had not stopped (since they even came to disrupt FPC). You are being a bit paranoid as you were when I reviewed one of your pictures in the most impersonal and objective way, as I always try to do. I just happens that among the things that I see, I support those that I think are right. No matter what. When I saw people doing wrong to you I condemned it. If I see you doing wrong I tell you. But not more than once. You say that I need some help. Go ahead, tell me the symptoms that you see. (In my talk page, since Alison should be annoyed with all these posts.) Abisharan (talk)

Common languages are all context dependent. This message is what it is within that contest. That's why I believe more in just copying.

 You are Spanish. 

You said ""edulcorantion,"" which is close to edulcorante, or ""sugar.""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.107.144.106   
 I did. Although it is also a word in English that means the same thing as sweetening. Also chemist used for the action of rinsing a beaker with water. It is a nice word, specially if you already used sweet-ie in a previous sentence. Things sound better when you dont have to repeat words.   "

Viriditas did ask you to block me for activity that was not a violation of the three revert rule - and you agreed!. Then he and Jayjg and sockpuppet friend continued to guard the Zionist hatchet job on Yasser Arafat preventing other editors from altering it and you dutifully protected the article for them while blocking me.  You admit to being biased against me  and then you block me and protect the Zionist version of Yasser Arafat.
