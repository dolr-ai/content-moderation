Text: The facts: 
1. This is a blatant lie, as proven here. Your comment dates from . The last version containing non-religious reasons for conversion to islam, which was active around that time, , did not compare zakat to jizya anymore. 
2. You have complained with a fellow administrator in order to get me blocked. Because already several lies from your side have been proven beyond doubt, this does not surprise me at all.
3. People that reverted were mainly Irishpunktom and you, both known for their pro-islamic POV and regularly cooperating in edit warring (also regarding several other articles, such as Apostacy and dhimmi, for instance, in order to press pro-islamic POV. All this indicates a coordinated campaign in order to press Islamist viewpoints.
4. Prove it. The fact is, I have sources, you don't even try to source your POV OR and take resort to weasel wording instead. I will force you to source your statement in my next edit. 
5. Prove it. I added sources for every statement I  inserted, while you failed to do so.
 I conclude that it is in Wikipedia interest you to withdraw from administratorship.

Text: "

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in ""keeping an eye on Jewish activities"".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the ""real Jews"".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews."

Text: inevitable development

sadly, people, the inevitable has happened: one of britain's most notorious far-right publications has pounced on the trivial link between patrons of jewish care and the 'cash for peerages' contretemps:

The scandal has also thrown a rare shaft of light on to the private world of Lord Levy and his web of connections with business and charities. They show that many of the Labour lenders had initially been donors to Lord Levy's favourite charities, such as the Community Service Volunteers, Jewish Care and the NSPCC. Three of the 12 who gave Labour loans  Andrew Rosenfield, Barry Townsley and Sir David Garrard  are also patrons of Jewish Care. The Aryan Advertiser 

typical 'conspiracy theory' drivel, but all the same it's touching that three goyim should feel such concern for the british-jewish community, am i right?  lemon or lime?

Since, I am leaving for vacation tomorrow morning, I was going to go in and vandalize your pages just before I left, you two were pissing me off so I just gave it away early that I was making a fool out of you two. Basically because you two are so damned gullible and got in some of my other enemies on it, Charlesknight and MathewFenton, I amde a fool out of them two. Anyways, I had some extra editing to do on the pages I liked so I came and made those edits. I really don't need to come here much as there isn't really anything I am interested in. However, when I want to come back after I come back from my vacation, I can do that very easily. Anyway, later suckers. Oh by the way YANDMAN, I love you. lol you dumbass. And Hybrid, you're sweet. LOL, You gullible fatass! Yandman thinks I don't have a static IP address.
