 My Appeal of the Deletion of Wikipedia Page: 'Judy Wood' 

Invalid reasons given for deletion. Deleting user: Zscout370 Reasons given for deletion: User said Dr. Judy Wood is not a notable person and that my page had Copyright violations. Reasons I am appealing: Dr. Judy Wood is a notable person, because she is the ONLY 9/11 researcher to file her evidence in a court of law. One of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court! No other 9/11 researcher has accomplished so much in the pursuit of truth and justice, yet many other 9/11 researchers have their own Wikipedia pages. This is not fair. In addition, the material on her website is not only fair use since it is a public website (www.drjudywood.com), but also, I have personally contacted Dr. Judy Wood via email, and she has given me permission to use any and all of the information on her website. She has pledged to email the Wikipedia Permissions staff within 48 hours to inform them that I do indeed have permission to use the information on her webpage. Therefore, the two reasons given for deletion are invalid, and my attempts to discuss this deletion at the Talk:Judy Wood page, were also deleted! This is censorship, and it is not in the spirit of Wikipedia. Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez 

Endorse. Clear and unambiguous copyvio.  talk 
Comment there was also an AFD in 2007  talk 

Endorse deletion - as far as I can, regardless of what is done in the future, it was a copyvio when deleted. Moreover, I see an article on this individual has already been deleted a number of times and also has subject to an AFD. I would salt the article space and tell anyone who wishes to make an article on this individual to do so in a sandbox and then get other people to assess the sources.    

Endorse deletion. Even ignoring the possible copyright problems, the article had no reliable independent sources about Judy Wood, which is a basic requirement (see e.g. WP:BIOfor more info on this).   

Response: Notability: Considering Dr. Wood is the ONLY 9/11 Researcher ever to file her evidence in a court of law, and considering that one of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court in October 2009, she is MORE notable than many 9/11 researchers that have their own pages, yet only hers seems to be deleted. When I try to input her name into the 9/11 Truth Movement wikipedia page, someone keeps deleting her name and any links to her research or court cases! This is UNFAIR, and this is not what Wikipedia is all about. Censorship and Unfairness are NOT what Wikipedia is about. Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez 

Response: References: In addition, 3 of the 5 references used are from EXTERNAL SOURCES. 1 is from a government website, and 2 are from Academic Universities. The only 2 sources used from her website are links to the legal documents she has scanned in. Please help Wikipedia, people are trying to censor Dr. Wood, and administrators have deleted the Wikipedia page that I created! This is unfair! Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez 

Response: Copyright Violation: I am also NOT in Copyright violation, because her information and photos are FAIR USE and are posted Publicly, but in addition to that, she has also given me permission personally, and will be emailing the Wikipedia Permission email to alert them to this within 48 hours.'' Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez 

I also have donated to Wikipedia in the past, and plan on donating a lot more, once I get done with medical school (I am broke right now).

Hijacker High (8/30) 
Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, Gail
Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
with money to help renovate it.

Text: Indeed, you're probably on to something. I think the Fourth Generation fighter page has really helped clear up things and added some much needed depth. If it is something that could be agreed on by the whole 'community' than perhaps there could be a seperate page for each generation of fighter jet linked from the main fighter aircraft page(and perhaps prop fighters as well). Until then though there isn't really any sort of guidline as to this specific page other for the sake of completeness. It is in my opinion that until seperate pages are created for Third, Second and First generation fighter jets then I don't really think the addition of one aircraft will really cause a lot of problem until such action is undertaken. Especially given that pretty much every single jet fighter is already on the list. The days of where nearly every country could create their own fighter like in WWII are long gone. Perhaps to at least organise the clutter, rather than listing aircraft vertically, it could be done horizontally like with the inter-war aircraft to at least make the page 'shorter'. To stay on topic though, is it agreed that the Mitsubishi F-1 is indeed, a fighter aircraft?

 My Draft of Kaithal honour killing case 

The Kaithal honour killing case is an honour killing of newly-married Manoj Banwala and Babli in June 2007 after a ‘khap panchayat' (caste-based council among Jats) in their Karora village in Kaithal district, Haryana, passed a decree prohibiting marriage against societal norms. Both belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community. Hence, they were declared brother and sister, though not directly related, and their marriage was declared invalid and incestuous. When the couple refused to abide by the ruling and got married, they were abducted and killed by the bride's relatives.

After the verdict of the Khap panchayat, the state government raised no concern. According to Home Minister P. Chidambaram, the UPA-led central government is to propose an amendment to the Indian Penal Code to outlaw honour killings.

In March 2010, a Karnal district court ordered the execution of the five perpetrators in this case, the first time a court in Haryana has ordered justice be served in an honour killing case. The court gave life sentence to the khap head who ordered the killings but did not participate, while the driver in the kidnapping was sentenced to seven years.

Murder
 on April 2007.]]
On April 6, 2007, Manoj Banawal, the owner of an electronics repair shop at Kaithal, eloped with Babli, a resident of the same village, to Chandigarh and applied for a registered marriage on May 31, 2007. They secretly married and started living in Karnal. Unhappy with the marriage, Babli's family asked the local khap panchayat to intervene, which dissolved the marriage. Families in Manoj's village were ordered not to talk to the couple. Manoj moved with Babli to another village and asked the police for help, which accompanied them to a Kaithal court on June 15, 2007. The judge ordered police protection for the two.

After the trial, Manoj and Babli, accompanied by police assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away.{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/op-ed/feudal-justice-feudal-crime-034|title=Feudal justice for a feudal crime|last=Sen |first=Antara Dev|date=3 April 2010|

Text: If you read the most thorough and credible works on the subject (see below), you will see that not only did the so-called Zebra murders flow directly from NOI theology, but that they were an NOI operation, directed from Chicago (aka New Mecca), and run out of the San Francisco mosque. The San Francisco death squad had pep rallies run by dignitaries from New Mecca after hours at the NOI-owned moving and storage where most of the killers worked, and all of them worked for NOI-owned businesses.

The apprentice Death Angels had to reach a certain quota from killing either four white children, five white women, or nine white men, in order to become full-fledge Death Angels, and receive free passage to Mecca. The practice of paying free passage to Mecca for killing “white devils” had been  instituted during the early 1930s by NOI founder Wallace Fard.

The NOI even paid for the defense of the three killers who refused to confess (Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, and Manuel Moore), but refused to pay legal fees for the one killer, Jesse Lee Cooks, who confessed to murder (the Frances Rose killing), and went so far as to disown Cooks. The NOI considers it a mortal sin to confess to any crime in the white man's courts.

To get an indication of how tightly the NOI operation was run, the case was only broken when one of the killers, Anthony Cornelius Harris, came forward, in order to collect the $35,000 reward, get police protection, and new identities for himself and his family. One day, when Harris & Family were in a motel under police guard, and Harris was in the shower, his foolish wife telephoned the wife of her minister, at the San Francisco mosque, and told her where they were holed up. In no time flat, a squad of NOI assassins (Fruit of Islam types, not the raggedy characters in the “Zebra” death squads) showed up at the motel, and Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos just managed to escape with the Harris family seconds ahead of the assassins.

Had the squad managed to kill Harris, the SFPD would never have broken the San Francisco cases (or at least, the 15 official San Francisco cases; there were more killings than that in the city by the bay). As it is, the convictions of Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore and Jesse Lee Cooks “cleared” only 15 killings, and the SFPD was convinced that at least three other men were part of the SF squad alone. However, the San Francisco DA, convinced that it had too little evidence to go to trial against the other three, dropped the charges against them.

The NOI is so tightly knit in its devotion to killing whites, whom it variously teaches are “white devils,” “blue-eyed devils,” and “grafted snakes,” that no one else came forward with information.
 
Not only did the NOI organize the death squads (there were many more than the one that went down), but the killings went on up and down the State of California, with different squads working different areas, and according to the FBI, even (though apparently, or rather, hopefully, to a lesser degree) on the East Coast. Dick Walley, the head of the Intelligence Analysis Unit at the California Department of Justice, had a dossier of 71 black-on-white murders committed across the state that he was convinced were NOI killings (Howard). (Walley died of cancer before the trial.) Clark Howard, the author of Zebra, was convinced that the NOI had murdered “just under 270” whites across California, but never named the other 255 victims, or explained his rationale. Since the murders were through and through an NOI operation, and only a small minority of them (even using Walley’s figure, which did not count non-California NOI racial killings) were committed in San Francisco, I suggest that we dispense with calling them the “Zebra Murders,” and simply call them the NOI Murders.

Contrary to those who have claimed that the NOI was seeking with the killings to cause a race war, the NOI was prosecuting a race war. The real story of how that war was stopped is one that I’m afraid we’ll never learn.

Looking over a couple of your contributions, I see some problems. One is, where you are not well versed in well-used phrases, you are nonetheless not hesitant to set people straight, when they were never wrong. Case in point, ""While traveling, Zinn died of an apparent heart attack while swimming""Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87"" The New York Times January 29, 2010. in Santa Monica, California on January 27, 2010. He is survived by his daughter Myla Kabat-Zinn, son Jeff Zinn and five grandchildren.""

'X is survived by Y' is common practice in obituaries. I am not going to argue with you about whether this is common practice on WP; you are mistaken in saying it does not make sense. Take note of this; you need to do more reading out and about in RL before you come here and presume to correct people.

The other, major, unequivocal, written in WP policy specifically, problem is that you have refactored other editor's talk page comments. Cease and desist forever, immediately. Talk pages are not subject to the same rules as mainspace. The only requirement is that they be an attempt, no matter how lame, to contribute suggestions for the improvement of the article.

Usage .""the term is sometimes used within Israel; predominantly by ""fanatical Jewish chauvinists"" for political motives, to describe Illegal Jewish Israeli settlements within the Occupied Palestinian Territories."" Shown by the term not being applied to Tel Aviv District.(Israel insider Ma'ale Adumim larger than Tel Aviv, I don't think so) Gush Emunim apply the term to the West Bank as a geopolitical manoeuvre devoted to an ideology ""greater land of Israel"".(Ha'aretz) The terms ""Judea and Samaria"" are also highly controversial in Israeli society itself, and are often employed specifically as a collective reference to the illegal Israeli settlements in that area, historically and presently, especially by Jewish settlers and their supporters.(Jpost Arutz Sheva) ""Newsweek Nov 20 1995""
[...] it stretches to the fanatical Jewish chauvinists who want to expel the Arabs from the land they call Judea and Samariaa territory that, depending on how you read the Bible, could stretch past the Jordan as far as the Euphrates. Says Sternhell: ""The minimum the religious Zionists can live with is the West Bank.""
""Newsweek Nov 13 1995"" The religious settlers in the occupied territories believe that God gave them the West Bankwhich they call by the Biblical names Judea and Samaria-and that no temporal leader can give the Promised Land away.  Left-wing Israelis prefer ""HaGada HaMa'aravit"" (הגדה המערבית ""The West Bank"" in Hebrew) or ""Hashetahim Hakvushim"" (השטחים הכבושים, The Occupied Territories). Many Arab Palestinians object to this term as a rejection of their claim to the land. Nevertheless, the term al-Yahudiyya was-Samarah is used by Arab Christians in reference to the Bible.(Murqus, Sa'īd. Tafsīr kalimāt al-Kitāb al-Muqaddas, Cairo, 1996, in Arabic)Jewish daily  As used by JVL in ""The College of Judea & Samaria"" where the college is described As a demonstratively Zionist institution, the College has two key requirements: every student must study one course per semester on some aspect of Judaism, Jewish heritage or Land of Israel studies, and the Israeli flag must be displayed in every classroom, laboratory and auditorium on campus.JVL

APCR again used by right wing extremists for West Bank.

Now lets' look at what the official name of the geopolitical area is:

US officially designates the West Bank the occupied territories.... Library of Congress 

Dore gold wants Disputed territories... B'Tselem occupied territories 

Britain's position...Occupied territories. 

Ireland Occupied territories...

UN occupied territories..

Red Cross; The ICRC in Israel, the Occupied Territories and the Autonomous Territories  indexed under Palestine, interesting.

and yet wiki uses a term that is controversial in Israel.

Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores

Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
"We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today," said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
"We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously," she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.

White House: President's "War Boner" Must Be Satisfied

..."The President can't seem to hide his excitement about a possible
military conflict with Iraq. At a recent function honoring America's
war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to
the subject of the Middle East.

'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other
nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq's
borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over
again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will
seed Iraq with American-style democracy.'

Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with
a special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton
administration.".....

Biased/Uninformed Triva

Smaller and lighter shotguns are more favorable in quail hunting due to the increased maneuverability needed for close ranges and fast prey. A longer and heavier shotgun is better suited for hunting larer waterfowl such as duck and geese that need to be fired upon at greater ranges. This bit of trivia implies that Cheney should be made fun of for using a ""women's"" shotgun, when in fact Kerry was the the fool all by himself.  "

Oddly enough we have been "discusing" this over in www.geocaching.com
Opinons on the it range from YeaBoy to ItsAgainstTheLAW. Mostly though its
either folks are boned up on the subject and are cool with it or they are
sheeple bleating to the big daddy to protect them. I sstill cant get my
head around the fact that so many people are so much the willing sheeple
for things like the Patriot Act and all the surrounding shackle racking.
