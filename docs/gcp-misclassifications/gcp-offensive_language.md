Picture this: Wikipedia user_A in China posts material that does not support the current government. User_B is also in China and privately messages user_A that they will report them to the authorities. (as they are required by law to do). Wikipedia would obviously not allow user_B to continue to help suppress the freedom of speech of User_A, especially since the Law of China has no authority over Wikipedia, and neither does the law of the US armed forces.
You, Orangemarlin are overstepping your duty, you cling to your past authority like a baby clings to their blanket. You have no business threatening anyone for their actions on wikipedia. Your intent is purely to feel some sort of power over another person, because if you were doing it out of duty you would have gone through with it without informing the second party of your actions. Shame on you. 64.230.92.23  23:08, 4

Text: This all is rubbish and has no bearing. After the advent of Islam Semitic names (Islam is a Semitic religion) started to emerge in India. Some Islamic scholars even concluded that Semitic prophets like, Ibrahim, Daud, Musa came to India. Many the names of many cities were changed Pryag became Allahabad. In 1894 Nicolas Notovitch a politically motivated person manufactured a lie that Jesus was in India. Subsequently a 15th century tomb of a Muslim was Yuz Asaf the tomb of Jesus. Documents were fabricated by Prof.Yasin and then Fida Hassnain a pseudo historian joined in and this agenda was pushed. No authentic Hindu scripture has anything to do with semiticism in any manner.

Mr LULU, Your Screed (statement) ""The latest....DAILY SLANDER"" is a bit over the top.  You sound like a partisan, POV Pusher, instead of a NPOV editor. Such a salacious  statements shows your lack of knowledge of the word  ""Slander"" (for the record proper usage is ""Liable""). I question your temperament to edit on such a politically charged article. 68.251.50.5

Text: Well you can't risk being blocked and thus your version of this article being reverted -so of course you're amused (as a misdirection).  More importantly you've dodged addressing the scientific point(s).   Also like a predictable troll you took the 'mispeling bait' (overlooking the correctly spelled version earlier in the sentence) and went on and bloviated from there hoping your futile misdirection would 'stick'.  LOL - we'll something sticks - that's fo sure.  But of course, you then had to follow up with a diaply of your immense knowledge of WP procedures etc etc no doubt trolling for a 'barn fish to the head -whack!' or whatever!  lol.
Oh yes - but of course YOUR tolerance and amusement and 'advise' and complicity (via fantasy slam remarks) attests to your overblown view of yourself and delusions about your skill in rightly dividing 'worth' from 'worthless'.  Your reward is that all your time spent here will be to no avail when it all gets 'speed deleted' and 'reverted' with the same air of arrogance as you have demonstrated here.  What comes around goes around - lol.  Carry on fool cs the youngins' need to see a sterling example of a blowhard editor like yourself to realize to steer clear of such a time-wasting task and exercise in self-delusion/power tripping.

No, Caspian, it is you and your mode of operation that is transparent.

That is the big problem with dealing with Caspian ... if anyone documents what THEY (Caspian blue) do, e.g. create noise as a distraction, they will turn around and use it in their next layer of attack attempting to draw attention away from them.

The prejudicial error in using Google as an arbitrator in a situation like this is that any search for 'Yonsei' will also bring results for 'Yonsei University' etc as a partial search results. 

Using it properly, e.g. search for Yonsei minus the word university  provides a far more accurate result for its usage. 

Yonsei means yonsei, Yonsei University is Yonsei University. Neither the hospital nor journals were ever called ""Yonsei"". The whole debate has been bogus and poisoned. 118.16.165.249  "

While it didn't go necessarily as how I planned. Since, I am leaving for vacation tomorrow morning, I was going to go in and vandalize your pages just before I left, you two were pissing me off so I just gave it away early that I was making a fool out of you two. Basically because you two are so damned gullible and got in some of my other enemies on it, Charlesknight and MathewFenton, I amde a fool out of them two. Anyways, I had some extra editing to do on the pages I liked so I came and made those edits. I really don't need to come here much as there isn't really anything I am interested in. However, when I want to come back after I come back from my vacation, I can do that very easily. Anyway, later suckers. Oh by the way YANDMAN, I love you. lol you dumbass. And Hybrid, you're sweet. LOL, You gullible fatass! Yandman thinks I don't have a static IP address. I am thinking about unhooking it tonight just to come back here tomorrow and vandalize his page to show him what a dumbass he is and how I can come back whenever I feel liek it. D

It would be nice if for once someone was actually willing to do something about that and their passive aggressive bullshit arguments and insults rather than persecute the submitter for being blunt when submitting them to ANI.
