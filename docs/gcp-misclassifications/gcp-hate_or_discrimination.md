Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, ""All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2

Text: The facts: 
1. This is a blatant lie, as proven here. Your comment dates from . The last version containing non-religious reasons for conversion to islam, which was active around that time, , did not compare zakat to jizya anymore. 
2. You have complained with a fellow administrator in order to get me blocked. Because already several lies from your side have been proven beyond doubt, this does not surprise me at all.
3. People that reverted were mainly Irishpunktom and you, both known for their pro-islamic POV and regularly cooperating in edit warring (also regarding several other articles, such as Apostacy and dhimmi, for instance, in order to press pro-islamic POV. All this indicates a coordinated campaign in order to press Islamist viewpoints.
4. Prove it. The fact is, I have sources, you don't even try to source your POV OR and take resort to weasel wording instead. I will force you to source your statement in my next edit. 
5. Prove it. I added sources for every statement I  inserted, while you failed to do so.
 I conclude that it is in Wikipedia interest you to withdraw from administratorship.

No, rather a new breakthrough in ballistic snake oil delivery. So it's
built into a walkthrough gate, and is noninvasive. It's supposed to
analyse brain and heart activity. While you can pick up heartbeat by
Doppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later
they mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation. Maybe
they're also doing a Kirlian reading, and recording your mana flux, too.
(Conclusive evaluation by entrail reading is nonoptional only for
confirmed terrorists).

So they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick
up by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low
number of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the
field.

Right.

Seems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant
pie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to 
invent a plausible lie.

Sigh.

This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of
female monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specifically
not the tail end of the distribution.  "By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]"

This has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.

So I chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post, since this
is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.


There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested
in typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably just
had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.


EOT, AFAIC.
