Hey you joker, self-proclaimed master of Wikipedia, if you want to delete my input then YOU go to the discussion page and explain why, my edits are legitimate and the article is sorely lacking in the details which I have begun to add. Don't delete my updates and tell me I need to explain, I have explained and it is YOUR turn to explain.

Text: "

What exactly does saying ""How are you niggers today?"" have to do with this discussion?  ""Nigger"" is a far more inflamatory word than ""homo"" is!  There are far more derogatory terms for homosexuals than homos - that would be on par with ""nigger"" - but I did not use any of them.  And whether admins are ""stupid"" or not is equally irrelevant.

I was blocked for 48 hours for doing what an admin said.  If saying ""homo"" is the cardinal Wiki-sin, at least shorten the block by the 48 hours that I was unfairly blocked.  "

Text: Aegean Macedonians vs Greek Macedonians/Bulgarian Macedonians 

Hi ChrisO,

I want an explanation as to why the article Aegean Macedonians was forced into the article Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia, while  Greek Macedonians and  Bulgarian Macedonians get to have their own article instead of being within the article Macedonia (Greece) and Blagoevgrad Province respectfully? 

Aegean Macedonian is a subgroup just like Greek Macedonian, or Bulgarian Macedonian is. I believe Aegean Macedonian should have their own article if the other two subgroups are allowed too.

Text: Qiyamah
I have been having a huge amount of trouble with a vandal ( on the Qiyamah page. I ask that he, and every other sockpuppet he uses be banned, and the page protected. Dmcdevit was previously contacted but has refused to take any action thus far. For more information see the Qiyamah talk page, Universaliss's talk page, and my talk page. Thank you for your time.  18:11, July 30, 2005 (UTC)
