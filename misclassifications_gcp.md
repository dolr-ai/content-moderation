 A hit list for Jews
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in ""keeping an eye on Jewish activities"".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the ""real Jews"".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews."

No, rather a new breakthrough in ballistic snake oil delivery. So it's
built into a walkthrough gate, and is noninvasive. It's supposed to
analyse brain and heart activity. While you can pick up heartbeat by
Doppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later
they mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation. Maybe
they're also doing a Kirlian reading, and recording your mana flux, too.
(Conclusive evaluation by entrail reading is nonoptional only for
confirmed terrorists).

So they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick
up by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low
number of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the
field.

Right.

Seems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant
pie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to
invent a plausible lie.

Sigh.

This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of
female monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specifically
not the tail end of the distribution.  "By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]"

This has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.

So I chose not to type "on average" explicitly in my post, since this
is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.


There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested
in typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably just
had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.

Mainichi Shimbun
Dec. 1, 2002

KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
as she rode an escalator here, police said.

Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law
forbidding people from creating a public nuisance.

Hamano admits to the allegations.

Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at
JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted
to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter.
She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs.

the subject of the Middle East.

'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other

 My Draft of Kaithal honour killing case

The Kaithal honour killing case is an honour killing of newly-married Manoj Banwala and Babli in June 2007 after a ‘khap panchayat' (caste-based council among Jats) in their Karora village in Kaithal district, Haryana, passed a decree prohibiting marriage against societal norms. Both belonged to the Banwala gotra, a Jat community. Hence, they were declared brother and sister, though not directly related, and their marriage was declared invalid and incestuous. When the couple refused to abide by the ruling and got married, they were abducted and killed by the bride's relatives.

After the verdict of the Khap panchayat, the state government raised no concern. According to Home Minister P. Chidambaram, the UPA-led central government is to propose an amendment to the Indian Penal Code to outlaw honour killings.

In March 2010, a Karnal district court ordered the execution of the five perpetrators in this case, the first time a court in Haryana has ordered justice be served in an honour killing case. The court gave life sentence to the khap head who ordered the killings but did not participate, while the driver in the kidnapping was sentenced to seven years.

Murder
 on April 2007.]]
On April 6, 2007, Manoj Banawal, the owner of an electronics repair shop at Kaithal, eloped with Babli, a resident of the same village, to Chandigarh and applied for a registered marriage on May 31, 2007. They secretly married and started living in Karnal. Unhappy with the marriage, Babli's family asked the local khap panchayat to intervene, which dissolved the marriage. Families in Manoj's village were ordered not to talk to the couple. Manoj moved with Babli to another village and asked the police for help, which accompanied them to a Kaithal court on June 15, 2007. The judge ordered police protection for the two.

After the trial, Manoj and Babli, accompanied by police assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away.{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/op-ed/feudal-justice-feudal-crime-034|title=Feudal justice for a feudal crime|last=Sen |first=Antara Dev|date=3 April 2010|

'X is survived by Y' is common practice in obituaries. I am not going to argue with you about whether this is common practice on WP; you are mistaken in saying it does not make sense. Take note of this; you need to do more reading out and about in RL before you come here and presume to correct people.

The other, major, unequivocal, written in WP policy specifically, problem is that you have refactored other editor's talk page comments. Cease and desist forever, immediately.

Text: Indeed, you're probably on to something. I think the Fourth Generation fighter page has really helped clear up things and added some much needed depth. If it is something that could be agreed on by the whole 'community' than perhaps there could be a seperate page for each generation of fighter jet linked from the main fighter aircraft page(and perhaps prop fighters as well). Until then though there isn't really any sort of guidline as to this specific page other for the sake of completeness. It is in my opinion that until seperate pages are created for Third, Second and First generation fighter jets then I don't really think the addition of one aircraft will really cause a lot of problem until such action is undertaken. Especially given that pretty much every single jet fighter is already on the list. The days of where nearly every country could create their own fighter like in WWII are long gone. Perhaps to at least organise the clutter, rather than listing aircraft vertically, it could be done horizontally like with the inter-war aircraft to at least make the page 'shorter'. To stay on topic though, is it agreed that the Mitsubishi F-1 is indeed, a fighter aircraft?

Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores

Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
"We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today," said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
"We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously," she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.

Usage .""the term is sometimes used within Israel; predominantly by ""fanatical Jewish chauvinists"" for political motives, to describe Illegal Jewish Israeli settlements within the Occupied Palestinian Territories."" Shown by the term not being applied to Tel Aviv District.(Israel insider Ma'ale Adumim larger than Tel Aviv, I don't think so) Gush Emunim apply the term to the West Bank as a geopolitical manoeuvre devoted to an ideology ""greater land of Israel"".(Ha'aretz) The terms ""Judea and Samaria"" are also highly controversial in Israeli society itself, and are often employed specifically as a collective reference to the illegal Israeli settlements in that area, historically and presently, especially by Jewish settlers and their supporters.(Jpost Arutz Sheva) ""Newsweek Nov 20 1995""
[...] it stretches to the fanatical Jewish chauvinists who want to expel the Arabs from the land they call Judea and Samariaa territory that, depending on how you read the Bible, could stretch past the Jordan as far as the Euphrates. Says Sternhell: ""The minimum the religious Zionists can live with is the West Bank.""
""Newsweek Nov 13 1995"" The religious settlers in the occupied territories believe that God gave them the West Bankwhich they call by the Biblical names Judea and Samaria-and that no temporal leader can give the Promised Land away.  Left-wing Israelis prefer ""HaGada HaMa'aravit"" (הגדה המערבית ""The West Bank"" in Hebrew) or ""Hashetahim Hakvushim"" (השטחים הכבושים, The Occupied Territories). Many Arab Palestinians object to this term as a rejection of their claim to the land. Nevertheless, the term al-Yahudiyya was-Samarah is used by Arab Christians in reference to the Bible.(Murqus, Sa'īd. Tafsīr kalimāt al-Kitāb al-Muqaddas, Cairo, 1996, in Arabic)Jewish daily  As used by JVL in ""The College of Judea & Samaria"" where the college is described As a demonstratively Zionist institution, the College has two key requirements: every student must study one course per semester on some aspect of Judaism, Jewish heritage or Land of Israel studies, and the Israeli flag must be displayed in every classroom, laboratory and auditorium on campus.JVL

APCR again used by right wing extremists for West Bank.

Now lets' look at what the official name of the geopolitical area is:

US officially designates the West Bank the occupied territories.... Library of Congress

Dore gold wants Disputed territories... B'Tselem occupied territories

Britain's position...Occupied territories.

Ireland Occupied territories...

UN occupied territories..

Red Cross; The ICRC in Israel, the Occupied Territories and the Autonomous Territories  indexed under Palestine, interesting.

and yet wiki uses a term that is controversial in Israel.

 My Appeal of the Deletion of Wikipedia Page: 'Judy Wood'

Invalid reasons given for deletion. Deleting user: Zscout370 Reasons given for deletion: User said Dr. Judy Wood is not a notable person and that my page had Copyright violations. Reasons I am appealing: Dr. Judy Wood is a notable person, because she is the ONLY 9/11 researcher to file her evidence in a court of law. One of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court! No other 9/11 researcher has accomplished so much in the pursuit of truth and justice, yet many other 9/11 researchers have their own Wikipedia pages. This is not fair. In addition, the material on her website is not only fair use since it is a public website (www.drjudywood.com), but also, I have personally contacted Dr. Judy Wood via email, and she has given me permission to use any and all of the information on her website. She has pledged to email the Wikipedia Permissions staff within 48 hours to inform them that I do indeed have permission to use the information on her webpage. Therefore, the two reasons given for deletion are invalid, and my attempts to discuss this deletion at the Talk:Judy Wood page, were also deleted! This is censorship, and it is not in the spirit of Wikipedia. Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez

Endorse. Clear and unambiguous copyvio.  talk
Comment there was also an AFD in 2007  talk

Endorse deletion - as far as I can, regardless of what is done in the future, it was a copyvio when deleted. Moreover, I see an article on this individual has already been deleted a number of times and also has subject to an AFD. I would salt the article space and tell anyone who wishes to make an article on this individual to do so in a sandbox and then get other people to assess the sources.

Endorse deletion. Even ignoring the possible copyright problems, the article had no reliable independent sources about Judy Wood, which is a basic requirement (see e.g. WP:BIOfor more info on this).

Response: Notability: Considering Dr. Wood is the ONLY 9/11 Researcher ever to file her evidence in a court of law, and considering that one of her court cases made it all the way to the Supreme Court in October 2009, she is MORE notable than many 9/11 researchers that have their own pages, yet only hers seems to be deleted. When I try to input her name into the 9/11 Truth Movement wikipedia page, someone keeps deleting her name and any links to her research or court cases! This is UNFAIR, and this is not what Wikipedia is all about. Censorship and Unfairness are NOT what Wikipedia is about. Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez

Response: References: In addition, 3 of the 5 references used are from EXTERNAL SOURCES. 1 is from a government website, and 2 are from Academic Universities. The only 2 sources used from her website are links to the legal documents she has scanned in. Please help Wikipedia, people are trying to censor Dr. Wood, and administrators have deleted the Wikipedia page that I created! This is unfair! Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez

Response: Copyright Violation: I am also NOT in Copyright violation, because her information and photos are FAIR USE and are posted Publicly, but in addition to that, she has also given me permission personally, and will be emailing the Wikipedia Permission email to alert them to this within 48 hours.'' Abraham Hafiz Rodriguez

I also have donated to Wikipedia in the past, and plan on donating a lot more, once I get done with medical school (I am broke right now).

Biased/Uninformed Triva

Smaller and lighter shotguns are more favorable in quail hunting due to the increased maneuverability needed for close ranges and fast prey. A longer and heavier shotgun is better suited for hunting larer waterfowl such as duck and geese that need to be fired upon at greater ranges. This bit of trivia implies that Cheney should be made fun of for using a ""women's"" shotgun, when in fact Kerry was the the fool all by himself.  "

Honest dealing with POVs is all I am interested in -)  Will proceed during weekend.

The word is used broadly and may describe the destructive action of natural phenomena like storms and landslides damaging physical things, accidental or intentional human destruction of property or injury to persons, or intentional psychological harm to those living under constant threat of physical abuse and/or verbal and emotional abuse.

Text: This all is rubbish and has no bearing. After the advent of Islam Semitic names (Islam is a Semitic religion) started to emerge in India. Some Islamic scholars even concluded that Semitic prophets like, Ibrahim, Daud, Musa came to India. Many the names of many cities were changed Pryag became Allahabad. In 1894 Nicolas Notovitch a politically motivated person manufactured a lie that Jesus was in India. Subsequently a 15th century tomb of a Muslim was Yuz Asaf the tomb of Jesus. Documents were fabricated by Prof.Yasin and then Fida Hassnain a pseudo historian joined in and this agenda was pushed. No authentic Hindu scripture has anything to do with semiticism in any manner.

Picture this: Wikipedia user_A in China posts material that does not support the current government. User_B is also in China and privately messages user_A that they will report them to the authorities. (as they are required by law to do). Wikipedia would obviously not allow user_B to continue to help suppress the freedom of speech of User_A, especially since the Law of China has no authority over Wikipedia, and neither does the law of the US armed forces.
You, Orangemarlin are overstepping your duty, you cling to your past authority like a baby clings to their blanket. You have no business threatening anyone for their actions on wikipedia. Your intent is purely to feel some sort of power over another person, because if you were doing it out of duty you would have gone through with it without informing the second party of your actions.

The prejudicial error in using Google as an arbitrator in a situation like this is that any search for 'Yonsei' will also bring results for 'Yonsei University' etc as a partial search results.

Using it properly, e.g. search for Yonsei minus the word university  provides a far more accurate result for its usage.

Yonsei means yonsei, Yonsei University is Yonsei University. Neither the hospital nor journals were ever called ""Yonsei"". The whole debate has been bogus and poisoned. 118.16.165.249  "

Since, I am leaving for vacation tomorrow morning, I was going to go in and vandalize your pages just before I left, you two were pissing me off so I just gave it away early that I was making a fool out of you two. Basically because you two are so damned gullible and got in some of my other enemies on it, Charlesknight and MathewFenton, I amde a fool out of them two. Anyways, I had some extra editing to do on the pages I liked so I came and made those edits. I really don't need to come here much as there isn't really anything I am interested in. However, when I want to come back after I come back from my vacation, I can do that very easily. Anyway, later suckers. Oh by the way YANDMAN, I love you. lol you dumbass. And Hybrid, you're sweet. LOL, You gullible fatass! Yandman thinks I don't have a static IP address.

Text: interview

dear dr . kaminski
i would like to thank for the interview opportunity at enron . it was very nice
and pleasant to talk with very talented people .
i wish this interview develop to the further stage of the opportunity .
as matter of fact , i have started the current job at kansas city with an
internship expiring november 3 rd . i got an permanent job offer from them and i
think i should decide whether to accept the offer or not very soon . but after
i visited enron , i feel that i want to pursue my career development at enron
for many reasons .
so if the decision process is made soon , i will appreciate it greatly . ( i
apologize for the hurry . i already sent a message regarding my situation to
molly a minute ago . )
thank you very much .

Text: tractebel signed vitro

ena entered into a purchase and sale agreement today to sell 80 % of our monterrey project to tractebel . it is anticipated that it will take 60 - 90 days to get idb and cfc approval , and have targeted a mid - august closing . some of you may be aware that tractebel attempted to add a new cp at the last minute ( last monday ) . we did not accept the cp but rather crafted another solution ( thanks maria elena ) of no real value to enron but with optical value to tractebel .
i will keep you all up to date as this transaction progresses .

Text: template for pricing the right of first refusal

shelley and chris ,
i have set up a template for pricing rofrs . the rofr is priced as a series
forward start options .
a forward start option gives the holder the right to exercise the option but
the strike price
is set at the money in future before the option expiration . the feature
mimics the " matching the best bid "
in the rofr . the underlying for the option is the " best bid " , which should
be closely related to the
price differential between the two hubs that the pipeline connects . therefore
the rofr is case dependent ,
as vince pointed out . the volatility can be estimated from the " best bid "
price history .
with these inputs we can estimate the value of rofr . if you have any
questions concerning the model
please feel free to call me or vince .
